            <p>Hey, I am Anushree this side a coder from passion and developer from the heart. Currently am pursuing my B.Tech in CSE Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. The journey of my life till now has been totally dedicated to coding like in all perspectives from learner to an intermediate level in short it's a great start. Coding has been my passion no matter how bad my day gets tapping on the keyboard makes it really good in the end.
                <p>So, this journey of learning is the best part of my life until now. There is not much to share as a beginner but I really appreciate your reviews on this dream of mine as a "DEVELOPER". </p>

               Since the beginning of my career, I’ve focused on channelling my talent and have always strived for excellence in my creativity and building something meaningful. I take pride in the work I do, as well as the strong relationships I’ve built with my colleagues. I firmly believe in working hard, working together and having fun along the way. If you’re interested in learning more about me or my work, simply reach out.  
               <p> The curiosity of how the programmer's world is getting evolved and irrespective of the fact it is growing the community of learners grew my interest more and more.</p>
